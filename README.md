# PixelProject-v2

A reimagined version of PixelProject, designed to showcase the latest advancements in my C++ skills and creativity. This project is an opportunity for me to take what worked well in the original PixelProject and build upon it, while also incorporating new ideas and improvements.

I've chosen to use Rider for this project, which offers limited support for C++ but allows me to leverage its built-in packages and simplify the development process. The ultimate goal of PixelProject-v2 is to continue honing my C++ knowledge and create a polished, functional project.

## Build

The project uses the nuget system for a lot of packages, more than the old previous attempt, so hopefully it should just be a matter of downloading and running locally. Greater attempts to maintain cross platform support between windows and linux will be made, but no guarantees. 

 ## Libraries
 
 I'll update this eventually should the project get far enough along that I think it matters.
 
 ## Contributing
Issues stating problems or feature requests are welcome, as are pull requests and any code contributions.
