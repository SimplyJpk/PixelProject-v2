# PixelProject-v2

A redux of PixelProject, after many many many many months of losing interest and no new ideas for other projects to start, I've decided to march down the road of insanity and throwing most of the previous project to the side. I'll pick and pull it apart taking what I liked and re-doing certain elements I think I could do better with my improved c++ knowledge from the start and a better understanding for what I want the final thing to look like.

The project purpose remains the same, mostly just for refining my C++ knowledge, and seeing what I can do. I've opt'ed this time to use Rider as it has limited c++ support, but also means I can continue to pretend that cmake doesn't exist and utilize sweet sweet nugets.

## Build

The project uses the nuget system for a lot of packages, more than the old previous attempt, so hopefully it should just be a matter of downloading and running locally. Greater attempts to maintain cross platform support between windows and linux will be made, but no guarantees. 

 ## Libraries
 
 I'll update this eventually should the project get far enough along that I think it matters.
 
 ## Contributing
Issues stating problems or feature requests are welcome, as are pull requests and any code contributions.
